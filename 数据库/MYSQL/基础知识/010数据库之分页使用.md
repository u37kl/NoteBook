limit 不用直接使用，需要配合子查询使用，否则会直接进行全表遍历，效率低下

```mysql
--下一页
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id in (SELECT id FROM table_name WHERE id > max_id LIMIT 10);
--上一页
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id in (SELECT id FROM table_name WHERE id < min_id ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10);
--当前页之后的某一页
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id in (SELECT id FROM (SELECT id FROM (SELECT id FROM table_name WHERE id < min_id ORDER BY id desc LIMIT (页数差*10)) AS N ORDER BY N.id ASC LIMIT 10) AS P ORDER BY P.id ASC);
--当前页之前的某一页
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id in (SELECT id FROM (SELECT id FROM (SELECT id FROM table_name WHERE id > max_id LIMIT (页数差*10)) AS N ORDER BY N.id DESC LIMIT 10) AS P) ORDER BY id ASC;
```
